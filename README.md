# Virtual Learning Experience Builder
## Team: VL-RedBack

### Project Overview

#### Project Goal
Our project aims to create a tool(lms plugin) or website-based platform that enables Engineering and IT academics with minimal training or experience to rapidly develop virtual or augmented learning experiences for educational use. This platform must be user-friendly, allowing educators to easily incorporate a variety of learning activities, such as information overlays, short quizzes, interactable items, and navigation within a 3D environment.

#### Core Functionality
- Enable users to construct basic 3D environments using either primitive elements (akin to Lego) or through 3D scanned data and photogrammetry.
- Facilitate the creation of a player character, including the definition of character capabilities (e.g., speed, jump height, size, motion controls, or guided movement).
- Allow for the integration of external content such as images, videos, and text, ensuring the environment is interactive and engaging.

#### Ideal Functionality
- Support the importation of complex media types, including quizzes and slide presentations.
- Enable the inclusion of sound effects and music to enrich the learning experience.
This project is initially focused on developing a proof of concept. Our objective is to create a versatile and intuitive platform that democratizes the development of VR/AR learning experiences, making it accessible to educators without requiring extensive technical expertise.
