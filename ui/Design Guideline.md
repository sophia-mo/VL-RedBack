   - Analyzed user needs and feedback to identify essential UI components.

2. **Development of Components**:
   - Designed initial UI elements like buttons and toggles.
   - Iteratively added complex elements such as iconed buttons and scrollbars.

3. **Standardization**:
   - Set rules for component states and interactions.
   - Defined uniform color schemes, typography, and iconography.

4. **Internal Review and Feedback**:
   - Reviewed designs with the team for usability and aesthetics.
   - Adjusted designs based on team feedback.

5. **Finalization and Documentation**:
   - Compiled and finalized all components into a guideline document.
   - Documented implementation rules and best practices.

6. **Implementation and Continual Refinement**:
   - Applied guidelines in Virtual Academyâ€™s development.
   - Established a process for updating guidelines based on ongoing feedback and needs.
