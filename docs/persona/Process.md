# Persona Development Process
### Research and Information Collection
Before creating the personas, the first step is to determine the occupational roles, which are the roles of stakeholders within the project. We conducted a detailed client meeting to specify the client's needs. After discussion, we confirmed our target user groups: teachers and students in college, especially from the engineering and IT disciplines.

### Analysis and Synthesis
The primary goal of our project is to provide a simpler and more convenient platform for users with no or minor experience in VR/AR, which is a key characteristic of the teacher user group. On the other hand, ease of use is critical for the student group and can be said to be a major advantage brought by the project, aimed at addressing user frustration. Besides these commonalities, the personas also need to meet the specific characteristics of the roles, such as teachers considering educational aspects, while students focus primarily on the experience.

### Persona Creation
To make the personas more representative, we made two personas, each for teachers and university students. Both are major stakeholders in the project and the main groups expressing demands. These two personas have significant differences in various aspects. Among these roles, teachers are the driving force behind establishing VR classrooms, while students will utilize this platform to gain a refreshing learning experience. 

### Continuous Improvement
We treat persona development as an iterative process. As the project scope evolves, we will revisit and revise the personas to ensure they remain relevant and accurately reflect our user base. This adaptive approach allows us to stay aligned with user needs and project goals.
