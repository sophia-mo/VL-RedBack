# Final Presentation Feedback Analysis

**Overall Evaluation:** The feedback provided constructive insights into various aspects of our final presentation, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

## Slides
- **Observation:** The slides contained excessive text, potentially diverting the audience's attention from the speakers.
- **Analysis:** This suggests a need to refine slide content, focusing on key points to enhance audience engagement and comprehension.

## Usability Test
- **Observation:** The usability test section lacked illustration of included scenarios prior to playing the low-fidelity prototype video. Additionally, there was no presentation on the changes made to the high-fidelity prototype based on client feedback.
- **Analysis:** To improve, we should provide an overview of test scenarios beforehand and explain how client feedback influenced prototype adjustments. This will ensure clarity and demonstrate our responsiveness to feedback.

## Organisation/Communication
- **Observation:** Speakers relied heavily on scripts, impacting the delivery's natural flow. One speaker also spoke faster than others, possibly due to time constraints.
- **Analysis:** To enhance communication, speakers should aim for a more natural delivery by relying less on scripts. Maintaining a consistent pace and focusing on key content points will improve clarity and engagement.

## Project Handover
- **Observation:** The handover plan was deemed thorough, but lacking a visual timeline for task completion.
- **Analysis:** Including a timeline diagram in the handover plan would provide a clearer overview of project milestones and deadlines, enhancing understanding and project management.

**Overall,** the feedback underscores the importance of concise and engaging presentation content, natural delivery, and visual aids for clarity. Addressing these areas will lead to more effective future presentations and project management.
