# Design User Story Map Process

## Introduction
Designing a User Story Map is a critical step in agile development, providing a visual representation of the product backlog. It helps in organizing and prioritizing user stories, ensuring that the team understands the user experience and delivers value incrementally. The following outlines the process of designing a User Story Map, explaining the rationale behind the release planning, and considering the complexity and priority of functionalities.

## Development Process
### 1. Understanding the User Story Map
A User Story Map visually lays out the user stories based on user activities and workflows. It typically has horizontal rows representing releases or iterations and vertical columns categorizing user activities or features. This layout helps in understanding the user journey and identifying essential features for each release.

### 2. Gathering User Stories
User stories are collected from stakeholders, users, and team members. These stories should be small, actionable, and provide value to the end-users. Each user story typically follows the format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]."

### 3. Categorizing User Activities
User stories are categorized based on user activities. For example, in the provided User Story Map, activities include Environment Creation, Account Management, Character Creation, Character Operation, Content Integration, Resource Event, and Resource Management. These categories help in understanding the broader functionalities and user interactions within the system.

### 4. Structuring Releases
Releases are structured based on the priority and complexity of user stories. The releases are organized to ensure that essential features are delivered first, providing a working product incrementally. Each release aims to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that adds value to the user.

### 5. Prioritizing User Stories
User stories are prioritized based on their importance to the user experience and the feasibility of implementation. The priority levels are:
- **Must Have (Release 1.0):** Critical features necessary for the core functionality of the product.
- **Should Have (Release 2.0):** Important features that enhance the user experience but are not critical for the core functionality.
- **Could Have (Release 3.0):** Nice-to-have features that add additional value.
- **Will Not Have (Unscheduled):** Features that are not planned for the current development cycle but may be considered in the future.

### 6. Mapping User Stories to Releases
User stories are mapped to specific releases based on their priority and complexity. For instance, the initial release (Release 1.0) focuses on fundamental functionalities like accessing edit mode, adding and adjusting items, importing assets, and basic character creation. Subsequent releases (Release 2.0 and 3.0) build upon this foundation by introducing more advanced features like external equipment control, detailed character customization, and resource management enhancements. The workload is balanced among sprints, as we estimated the size of user stories and placed them evenly in each sprint.

### 7. Iterative Development and Feedback
The development follows an iterative approach, where each release is developed, tested, and reviewed. Feedback from stakeholders and users is incorporated into the next iteration, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.

### Release Planning Rationale

#### Release 1.0
- Focuses on core functionalities necessary to start using the environment creation tool.
- Prioritizes features like accessing edit mode, adding items, and basic character control.
- Ensures that users can begin creating and managing their environments with essential tools.

#### Release 2.0
- Introduces advanced functionalities that enhance user interaction and control.
- Adds features like saving environment configurations, external equipment support, and detailed character operations.
- Provides a more immersive and interactive experience, allowing for more complex creations.

#### Release 3.0
- Expands on character customization and fine-tuning player controls.
- Includes features like defining player speed, jump height, and integrating external resources.
- Enhances the userâ€™s ability to create detailed and dynamic environments.

#### Unscheduled
- Contains lower-priority features that are not critical for the initial releases.
- These features are marked as "will not have" for the current development cycle but may be revisited based on user feedback and project scope changes.
- Includes functionalities like advanced account management options and additional content integration methods.

## Summary
The design of a User Story Map in agile scrum development is a strategic process that ensures a clear understanding of user needs and systematic delivery of value through iterative releases. By prioritizing and mapping user stories effectively, the development team can focus on delivering high-priority features first, while progressively adding enhancements and additional functionalities in subsequent releases. This approach not only aligns with agile principles but also ensures a user-centric development process.
