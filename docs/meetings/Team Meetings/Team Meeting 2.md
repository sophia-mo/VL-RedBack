## Action Items:

### Checked Checklist

#### Personas
Make sure that your personas satisfy the following criteria:

- [x] Realistic:The personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners. 
- [x] Range:The personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system. There is evidence that a variety of types of personas have been considered (*diversity is extremely important*). 
- [x] Distinct:The personas present distinct behaviours and do not overlap (unless justified by the students). 
- [x] Usefulness:The personas present a rich description of the users and give a good understanding of the person's motivation and behaviour. 
- [x] Presentation:The presentation of the personas is elegant and attractive, they are well written, clear, without ambiguities or typos. 
- [x] Process: There is evidence that the process to create personas has been followed and it has been well documented.

#### User Stories
Make sure that your user stories satsify the following criteria:

- [x] Complete:The user stories completely cover the capabilities required by the client. 
- [x] Consistency:The user stories are consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts. 
- [x] Justification:The user stories include justification ("so that") IF appropriate. 
- [x] Priorities:User stories are well prioritized. The priorities can be traced back to the client and the choice of prioritization mechanism has been justified by the students. 
- [x] Presentation: The user stories document is clearly laid out. The user stories are well-written and they are unambiguous. They contain no typos or spelling errors.

#### GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [x] Folders are structured
- [ ] Sprint 2 documents were exported as PDF and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
