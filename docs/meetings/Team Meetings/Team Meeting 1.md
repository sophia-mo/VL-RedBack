## Agenda
### 1. Opening (15 minutes)
Briefly review the purpose of the meeting: **Planning for Sprint 2**.

Ensure that all team members are present and understand the checklist requirements for Sprint 2.
#### Personas
Make sure that your personas satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Realistic:The personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners. 
- [ ] Range:The personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system. There is evidence that a variety of types of personas have been considered (*diversity is extremely important*). 
- [ ] Distinct:The personas present distinct behaviours and do not overlap (unless justified by the students). 
- [ ] Usefulness:The personas present a rich description of the users and give a good understanding of the person's motivation and behaviour. 
- [ ] Presentation:The presentation of the personas is elegant and attractive, they are well written, clear, without ambiguities or typos. 
- [ ] Process: There is evidence that the process to create personas has been followed and it has been well documented.

#### User Stories
Make sure that your user stories satsify the following criteria:

- [ ] Complete:The user stories completely cover the capabilities required by the client. 
- [ ] Consistency:The user stories are consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts. 
- [ ] Justification:The user stories include justification ("so that") IF appropriate. 
- [ ] Priorities:User stories are well prioritized. The priorities can be traced back to the client and the choice of prioritization mechanism has been justified by the students. 
- [ ] Presentation: The user stories document is clearly laid out. The user stories are well-written and they are unambiguous. They contain no typos or spelling errors.

#### GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured
- [ ] Sprint 2 documents were exported as PDF and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint 

### 2. Discussion on Personas (20 minutes)
- Realistic: Present research findings and discussions with industry partners that will inform the creation of personas.
- Range: Brainstorm to ensure personas cover a wide range of target user behaviors, emphasizing the importance of diversity.
- Distinct: Discuss how to ensure personas are distinct and avoid overlap unless justified.
- Usefulness: Evaluate each persona draft for richness in the description, motivation, and behavior understanding.
- Presentation: Assign team members to review persona presentations for clarity, attractiveness, and absence of errors.
- Process: Review and document the process used to create personas.

### 3. Crafting User Stories (20 minutes)
- Complete: Ensure user stories cover all client-required capabilities.
- Consistency: Discuss how user stories align with the client's problem understanding and other artefacts.
- Justification: If applicable, include justifications in user stories.
- Priorities: Prioritize user stories, justifying choices based on client input.
- Presentation: Assign a review of user stories for clarity, correctness, and formatting.


### 4. GitHub Repository Organization (15 minutes)
- Folders: Decide on the folder structure for Sprint 2 documents.
- PDF Exports: Assign team members to export Sprint 2 documents as PDFs and add them to the repository.
- README Update: Assign team members to update the README file to reflect Sprint 2's focus and updates.
- Baseline Tag: Discuss and agree on a baseline tag for Sprint 2, ensuring all team members know how to use it.

### 5. Assigning Tasks and Deadlines (20 minutes)
Based on the discussions, assign specific tasks to team members.
Set deadlines for each task, considering the sprint timeline and any dependencies between tasks.
The task allocate result is in the Action Points part.

## Decisions
After analysing the work for Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, we found that it is not practical to allocate a few tasks to 9 members evenly, so we decided to work alternatively.
We split our group of 9 into two groups. The first group works in Sprint 2, and the second group checks and improves results. In Sprint 3 we will swap the sides, the second group works and the first group checks and improves the result. This strategy ensures we avoid task granularity being too small so that the tasks can be efficiently assigned and completed. At the same time, all of the members will involved in every sprint and learn in practice.

## Action Points
Sprint 2 tasks & assignee:
- **Persona design & content:** Zhuyun Lu
- **User story creation & prioritization:** Mingyang Lai, Wenquan Wan
- **GitHub update & refine:** Mo Chen
- **All content review & improve:** Tianyi Zhong, Keang Lyu, Shanqing Huang, Yinuo Li, Henagjia Cao
