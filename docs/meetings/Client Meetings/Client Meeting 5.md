### **Agenda:**

* Presentation of High Fidelity Prototype
* Feedback and Suggestions
* Q&A Session

### **Discussion Points:**

* **Prototype Presentation:**
  * The team presented the first version of their high fidelity prototype.
  * Demonstration included environment creation, object manipulation, and interactivity features.
  * Features shown:
    * Creation of environments (ESJ King's Theater, accommodation, simple ground).
    * Object placement and manipulation (rotation, scaling, importing images).
    * Saving and loading of maps.
    * Interaction with objects (lights, images) in play mode.
    * Character creation and customization.
    * Advanced interactive system (e.g., linking buttons to control lights).
* **Feedback from Reviewer:**
  * **Overall Impression:**
    * The prototype demonstrated all the planned functionalities effectively.
    * The presentation was clear and comprehensive.
  * **Specific Feedback:**
    * **Teacher View:**
      * The right-hand side object information panel is cluttered and could be simplified.
      * Most users will likely use handles to manipulate objects rather than typing in exact numbers.
      * Suggested a toggle option to show/hide advanced settings for users who want to tweak numbers.
      * Local position adjustments are more relevant than global positions for ease of use.
    * **Object Interaction:**
      * Implement a grid-based movement and object snapping system to simplify object placement.
      * Consider a decision tree for object parenting to manage how objects move together.
    * **Character Creation:**
      * Character customization should be controlled by the teacher for consistency in the virtual environment.
      * Future versions could include more detailed character customization for multiplayer scenarios.
    * **Quizzes and Interactivity:**
      * The prototype should include functionality for quizzes or similar interactive elements.
      * Suggested using a similar interaction method as images, with pop-up windows for quiz questions.
* **Q&A Session:**
  * The team confirmed understanding of the feedback and discussed possible implementations.
  * The reviewer clarified expectations for the final submission and the handling of quiz functionalities.

### **Action Items:**

* **Simplify Teacher View:**
  * Reduce clutter in the object information panel.
  * Implement a toggle for advanced settings.
* **Enhance Object Interaction:**
