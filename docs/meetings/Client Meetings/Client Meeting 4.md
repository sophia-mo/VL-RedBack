### Agendas

- Show client about the Low Fidelity Prototype we made in this sprint.
- Conduct the Usability Test with the client.
- Show the client about some parts from the High Fidelity Prototype.

### Notes

- The client was mostly satisfied.
- The client gave us suggestions about the design:
    - The `Instruction Hint` should be able to be hidden to a minimal UI element.
    - The logic of controlling a object should be similar to the logic in other 3D softwares like Unity3D.
    - The buttons like `Save`, `Save As`, `Rename` should be in a menu.
    - The panel at the right hand side can be panel for properties like making things interactable, like by interacting with the object, the lights turn off.
- The client was happy about we are doing validation of Low Fidelity Prototype with High Fidelity Prototype.
    - Client mention that we can do a skybox and model preset selection.

### Action Items

### Decision Items

- Make buttons in a menu.
- Add skybox and model preset selection dialog.
- Make control logic on the 3D obejct mimic Unity3D's logic

### FAQ

#### Q: What's the style of the global pause menu?

A: Like MS Office's style but not the fullscreen one. (Presumably the style of Office 2007)

#### Q: Can we implement snapping by predefining snap points on the objects?

A: Sure, for the prototype.

#### Q: What should we have for the login page in the high fidelity prototype?

A: You can just put a photo of the school, or a constantly rotating 3D environment.
