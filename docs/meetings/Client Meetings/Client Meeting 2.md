### Agenda:

#### Confirm the work is consistent with the client's expectation
Refine the user stories:
- Complete: The user stories completely cover the capabilities required by the client. 
- Consistency: The user stories are consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with other artefacts. 

Refine persona:
- Realistic: The personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners. 
-  Range: The personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system. There is evidence that a variety of types of personas have been considered (*diversity is extremely important*). 

### Action Items:

No Action items was made at this meeting.

### Decisions:

- User Story 3.1-3.3 are not important in this demo project. However 3.4 and 3.5 are important.

- Different character models will have different eye levels. (e.g.: Person in a seated position)

- Long press of mouse buttons to pick up items into the backpack, probably be a single key press, like pressing 'E'.

- Simplify the button control scheme.

- User story 7.6 should be teacher only.

- The environment is interactable, like one person can push a button to start an animation and another can push the button to stop the animation.

- Access via web browser is not necessary.

- The must have version of resource library is just a folder on acadmic computer.

#### Q: Does users can operates the environment together?

A: Yes, maybe one person pushes a button to open a door for another person to walk through that door.
