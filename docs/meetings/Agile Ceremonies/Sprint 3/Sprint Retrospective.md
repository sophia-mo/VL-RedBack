2. **Acceptance Criteria Development:**
   * Allocate dedicated time and resources for the completion of acceptance criteria documentation in the upcoming sprint.
   * Collaborate with clients to define clear and measurable acceptance criteria for each user story, ensuring alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.
   * Regularly review and update acceptance criteria as needed throughout the sprint to reflect evolving project needs and feedback received.
3. **Feedback Incorporation:**
   * Establish a systematic process for collecting and incorporating feedback from clients and usability testing into further iterations of the prototype.
   * Prioritize feedback based on its impact on project goals and user experience, ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly.
   * Utilize feedback as an opportunity for continuous improvement, iteratively refining the prototype to better meet clients' expectations.
