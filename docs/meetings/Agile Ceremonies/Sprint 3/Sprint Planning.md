## Agenda
## Complete Low-Fidelity Prototype:
 >* **Interface Design**: Design the initial functional prototype focusing on simplicity and intuitiveness. Consider the inclusion of drag-and-drop elements for 3D object placement and interaction setups.
 >* **Basic Features Implementation**: Start by adding some basic features into the functional prototype.
 >* **Multiple UI/UX design**: Do multiple UI/UX designs for some User Stories and gather feedback to decide which one to be implemented in the High Fidelity prototype.

## Conduct Usability Tests
>* **Participant Selection**: Identify a diverse group of participants, including academics and educators with varying levels of technical expertise.
>* **Testing Setup**: Create scenarios that cover typical use cases, such as building a simple 3D classroom or adding interactive quizzes.
>* **Data Collection**: Use surveys, interviews, and direct observation to collect data on user experience, interface intuitiveness, and feature adequacy.
>* **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Plan for quick iterations based on feedback to refine the prototype. This may involve weekly sprints to address critical usability issues.

## Write Documents for Acceptance Criteria:
>* **Feature Specification**: Clearly define what each feature should do and how it should perform, aligning with the core and ideal functionalities described in the proposal.
>* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Criteria**: Outline specific scenarios and tasks that the users must be able to perform, detailing the expected outcomes and necessary steps for each.
>* **Documentation Structure**: Organize the documentation into sections that address different aspects of the platform, such as technical specifications, user instructions, and developer notes.
