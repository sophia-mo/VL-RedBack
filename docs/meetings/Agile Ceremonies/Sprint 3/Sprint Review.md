### Next Steps:

**User Story Refinement:**

* Continue refining user stories to ensure clarity and alignment with project goals.
* Address any remaining issues to facilitate acceptance criteria development.

**Acceptance Criteria Development:**

* Prioritize completion of acceptance criteria documentation in the upcoming sprint.
* Ensure alignment with revised user stories and project objectives.

**High-Fidelity Prototype Development:**

* Prioritize the development of the high-fidelity prototype based on finalized user stories and updated UI/UX designs.
* Implement feedback received from clients and usability testing to enhance the prototype's functionality and user experience.

**Data Sample Collection and Analysis:**

* Collect relevant data samples during usability testing sessions.
* Analyze collected data to identify trends, areas for improvement, and potential bottlenecks in user interaction with the prototype.

**User Story Map Refinement:**

* Update the user story map based on revisions made to user stories and feedback received during Sprint 3.
* Ensure that the user story map accurately reflects the current state of the project and serves as a roadmap for development.

**Acceptance Tests Development:**

* Define acceptance tests based on finalized user stories and acceptance criteria.
* Ensure that acceptance tests cover all essential functionality and user interactions expected from the high-fidelity prototype.
