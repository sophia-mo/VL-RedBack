### Agenda

* Current progress on the GitHub page
* High fidelity prototype and user store map
* Logic for moving objects, altering size, and rotation
* Presentation details and scheduling

### **Meeting Summary:**

* **GitHub Page Navigation:** Discussed the addition of repository navigation links. It was agreed that only necessary links should be included for easy navigation.
* **User Store Map:** Confirmed that the user store map should be based on user stories and planned for the next semester without specific timeframes, just sprint numbers.
* **High Fidelity Prototype:** Showcased the logic implementation for moving objects, altering size, and rotation. Mentioned the implementation of a plugin and received feedback on documenting layout changes and user training instructions.
* **Presentation Schedule:** Discussed the timing of the presentation and the possibility of arriving slightly late. Confirmed that it is acceptable as long as the tutor is informed.
