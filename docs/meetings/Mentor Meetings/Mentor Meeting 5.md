### Question & Answer

#### If using a better technique lick Figma when developing the low-fidelity will influence our final mark?

A: The mark only effected by the requirements in the rubric. As long as you can create a prototype that allows you to test that, and record, respond in the mistakes testees make and what testees struggles with, improve the design upon that. If you can demostrate that your paper prototype is effective for that and you done usability session, give them (users/testees) scenarios to do. And they've done it and you've taken the feedback from that and you have used that to adjust your design, then you will get good mark.
